/** An API for simple synchronous server apps that support multiple users over WebSockets.
  *
  * The synchronous approach is designed to be analogous to the javascript
  * concurrency model.
  *
  * All functions (and any registered tick function) are called synchronously.
  * For example, the framework will never deliver a message() until the previous
  * message() has been processed.
  *
  * The synchronous approach limits the parallelism available to the server
  * application, which has latency and scalability disadvantages. The advantage
  * is that applications are easier to write.
